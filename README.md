# vim-localvimrc

**This project is no longer supported.**  I have switched over to
[embear/vim-localvimrc](https://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc) because it is
much better.

This is a very light plugin that searches up the directory tree until it finds a
.lvimrc file and sources it. This is useful for project-specific vim
configurations.
